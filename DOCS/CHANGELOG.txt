1.0.2.ub1604lts - March 25, 2017

- Bugfix: Removed some leftovers regarding glusterfs
  support in cinder.

1.0.1.ub1604lts - March 25, 2017

- Fully removed glusterfs cinder volume backend option.
  The driver was deprecated (but still available) on
  Newton release, but completelly removed on Ocata.
- Added snapshoot and qcow support on our implementation
  of the NFS driver on Cinder.

1.0.0.ub1604lts - March 24, 2017

- All modules adapted to OpenStack Rel 15 "Ocata".
- MongoDB fully deprecated in favor of GNOCCHI. All
  needed configurations and installation actions are
  performed by ceilometer install module, which also
  installs and configure gnocchi.
- As a result of gnocchi introduction, all metric re-
  lated functions are performed by gnocchi. This also
  include client interactions, that need to be per-
  formed using openstack client instead of old ceilo-
  metet client.
- Because we are using gnocchi now, ceilometer end-
  points in keystone are no longer needed (so they are
  not created). Also, the ceilometer-api is not con-
  figured either. All metric and events are now con-
  sumed trough gnocchi and aodh clients using the
  python openstack cli.
- CELLS setup included in the installer. Because now
  cell setup is "mandatory" for nova, our installer
  takes the apropiate steps to install and configure
  all needed support, including the new cell db.
- New placement api included in nova setup. The API is
  served trough a WSGI using apache.
- Some API's are using apache now (trough wsgi). Those
  include:
  * aodh-api.
  * placement-api (part of nova now).
  * cinder-api (only in Ubuntu based installs).
  * gnocchi-api.
- Designate install module adjusted to use the worker/
  producer model.
